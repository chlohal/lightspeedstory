            <p>Sadly, it's impossible to go <em>to</em> light-speed. When you do, things break.</p>
            <p>In order to see light-speed, this story uses <span class="magicunits">magic velocity units</span>.
                Don't worry about how fast they are; all you need to know is that light moves at about <span

            <h2>Relativity</h2>
            <p>In our universe, <u>everything is relative</u>. This was famously summed up by Albert Einstein in two
                basic
                <span class="postulate">postulates</span>:
            </p>
            <ol class="biglist postulates">
                <li>The laws of physics treat all things in <span
                        title="Meaning that neither are accelerating.">uniform</span> motion <strong>the same</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>The speed of light is <strong>the same</strong> everywhere.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>These seem obvious-- of course, the laws of physics don't play favorites!
                Einstein's main contribution to relativity was how he used the <span class="postulate">two
                    postulates</span>
                in a system to construct his theory of Special Relativity.</p>
            <p>Let's start with normal, not-light-speed relativity.</p>
            <p><strong>Below, you can click on the people to see the scenario from their point of view.</strong></p>

            <div class="starry view" data-viewid="relativity"></div>

            <p>Even though everyone gets different measurements, <span class="character-taylor">Taylor</span> is
                <em>always</em> moving <span class="magicunits nohighlight">20 mvu</span> faster than <span
                    class="character-bob">Bob</span>, and <span class="character-allie">Allie</span> is <em>always</em>
                moving
                <span class="magicunits nohighlight">20 mvu</span> faster than <span
                    class="character-taylor">Taylor</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's relativity! In space, there's no objective concept of "stationary"-- even <em>our</em> planet is
                moving around. To be
                accurate, you have to measure movement <span class="postulate">relatively</span>. For example, <span
                    class="character-taylor">Taylor</span> is moving at 20 mvu <span class="postulate">according
                    to</span> <span class="character-bob">Bob</span>.
            </p>
            <p>Even though relativity was well-known before Einstein made his theory, he wanted to re-state it for the
                sake of clarity. The most important idea is the second postulate:</p>

            <h2>Special Relativity</h2>
            <div class="starry view" data-viewid="specialrelativity"></div>
            <p>
                <span class="character-taylor">Taylor</span> and <span class="character-bob">Bob</span> still move
                relatively to one another. However, the light particle <em>always</em> moves at <span
                    class="magicunits">100 mvu</span> from <em>everyone's</em> perspective.
            </p>
            <p>If you're moving at <span class="magicunits">3 mvu</span> (<span class="postulate">relative
                    to</span> me), any light that we see is moving at 100 mvu <span class="postulate">relative to</span>
                <em>both</em> of us. This is different from if <span class="character-allie">Allie</span> was moving at
                4 mvu relative to me: that would only be 1 mvu from your view.
            </p>

                So far, the space simulations have been ignoring a lot of the <abbr title="relativistic">weird</abbr>
                physics that come into effect at these speeds. Human brains aren't used to relativistic physics since we spend all our time at lower speeds.
